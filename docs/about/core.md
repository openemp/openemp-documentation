## What is OpenEMP

OpenEMP is techincally a microservices web system serve to provide a set of tools and logical apps, so all together manage the education workflow.

OpenEMP is separated into components (service) that are completely isolated, services are meant to be highly configurable and independently deployable.

We so far have 4 types of services:

- **API Service**: a REST API web application that use JSON as a representation format
- **data Service**: responsible on storing data for an API service, this could be a SQL , NoSQL database, or a filesystem volume... 
- **UI Service**: is a frontend web application that fetch resources from API service and display a UI web component
- **System Service**: is a service that play a role in the orchestration between services, doesn't take part of the education model but ensure the data management across services

!!! note
    data service should only communicate with one API service (it's a OneToOne relationship)


## Services Design

The following sketch is a demonstration of OpenEMP microservices:

For more details about OpenEMP services, please check the services documentation [here](../services/index.md)

## Data model

here is the initial core data model for OpenEMP

!!! note
    OpenEMP Initial Data model is set for demonstration and most relationships will be break down because of the microservices architecture.
