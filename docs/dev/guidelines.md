# Guidelines:

All source code is available in Github

- Open an issue in the repository where you want to contribute (follow the template)
- You can pick one of the issues and come talk about it in [Discord](@Discord)
- Request to book issue (Need more research)
- Set a PR:
    - PR name should be in a narative form (Action + Ad...)
    - PR description should have a ticket number to fix (eg. Fix #10, to Fix the issue #10)
    - Optionally set a reviewer when availble
    - PR should only be merged after review
- PR's may be closed without warning for any of the following reasons: lack of an associated Github issue, lack of tests, lack of proper documentation, or anything that isn't within the intended development roadmap of OpenEMP.
- If you are working on an existing issue posted by someone else, please ask to be added as Assignee so that effort is not duplicated.
- If you want to contribute to an issue someone else is already working on please get in contact with that person via Discord or GitHub and discuss your collaboration.
- If you wish to create your own issue or PR please explain your reasoning within the Issue template and make sure your code passes all the CI checks.

**Caution**: We try our best to keep the assignee up-to-date, but as we are all humans with our own schedules mistakes happen. If you are unsure, please check the comments of the issue to see if someone else has already started work before you begin.
